# Python Practice Files

This repository contains my Python practice scripts created while learning programming concepts such as variables, loops, functions, and data structures. These files are for educational purposes to track my progress.

## How to Use
1. **Install Python**:
   - Download Python 3 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it.
   - Ensure Python is added to your PATH (check with `python --version` in terminal).
2. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   ```
3. **Run Scripts**:
   - Navigate to the repository folder: `cd your-repository-name`.
   - Run a script: `python script_name.py` (e.g., `python hello_world.py`).
   - Some scripts may require libraries (listed in `requirements.txt` if included).

## Notes
- Scripts cover beginner topics like conditionals, lists, and file handling.
- Files are organized by topic or exercise (e.g., `basics/`, `functions/`).
- For questions, open a GitHub issue.
